# Mr White Game

Simple Project using React, VueJS and TailwindCSS. Used the shadcn/ui for some components.
Currently depoyed on [here](https://mrwhite-game.vercel.app/).
The project is in Portguese, and the ideia come up because my friend group plays the famous Mr.White game on a application that only gives no more than 10 different words for free. With that said, I took the oportunity to develop this project, using the word list that me and my friend group create.

#Futher Features and Optimizations
-Create the Undercover player, for that each word from the wordlist needs to have a similar word atach to it.
-Take it a step foward, make a lobby so all can join and see their word, display the order in each player device, and so on...
